<!-- # Welcom to my homepage!  -->

I am Minrui Luo, currently a senior student from Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, also known as Yao Class), Tsinghua University. I am particularly interested in bridging rigorous theoretical understanding with practical model design - studying how analyses of optimization dynamics, efficient adaptation, and causal structure can both explain and guide modern learning systems.

I am particularly interested in bridging rigorous theoretical understanding with practical model design - studying how analyses of optimization dynamics, efficient adaptation, and causal structure can both explain and guide modern learning systems. My previous work spans the following areas:

* Optimization & Deep Learning Theory

* Parameter-Efficient & Safe Fine-Tuning

* Causal Inference & Robust ML
